Enemies vary depending on the level you're on.
Powerups vary depending on the which level you're on.

Game was tested on Mac and Windows, both worked well.

You have 3 lives. Once all 3 lives are gone a gameover screen will show and you will be brought back to the mainmenu after 3 seconds.
Deathzones (transparent red zones) are an instant kill regardless of how many lives you have left.

Coins have no function besides being collectable and increasing your coin count.

Levels are randomly generated, they have a predefined baseplate for the floor. But platforms, enemies, powerups and coins are all randomly generated.
Once you reach the end you will see a win screen which you can continue to next level or go back to main menu if you beat it.

Have volume up as there is some music in the game

You should encounter all powerups and enemies but it may take a couple replays of each level to make sure, this is because they are random so there is a chance that
with your luck you may not get them on the first couple tries.

The main menu title is in sync with the music so it will bounce around to the beat.
